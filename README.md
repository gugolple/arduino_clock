# arduino_clock
This project is still work in progress.

The main idea is to use a led matrix of w2812b to have a big clock which i could remotely control with an old tv remote. I really wanted for it to not be and iot for my own personal reasons.
Currently it displays the current time since it has been turned on, it remains to be coded the hability to configure the current time and the color being used.
